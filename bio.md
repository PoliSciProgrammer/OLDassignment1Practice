Programming Backround:


Hobbies:
    I enjoy reading political news and searching for bias - which is pretty easy to do with todays print media.  I also enjoy my job fixing computers for a technology company.  I am currently persuiting a Computer Science degree (to supplement my Political Science degree) in order to create an algorithm that finds online political articles and sorts them for me to read.
    
    
Work:  
    Currently work at a tech company that is a Value Added Retailer (in other words they mostly sell hardware and supplement the hardware with managed services: managed services being someone like me that diagnoses, fixes, images, and stores computers that are defective for clients.
